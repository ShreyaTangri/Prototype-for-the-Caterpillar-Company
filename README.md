# Prototype-for-the-Caterpillar-Company
# Remote Control Tractors
Caterpillar has been using remote controllers to operate vehicles for safety and productivity. Can we further improve remote control system with what we learnt in UX course? In this project, our team worked with Caterpillar to prototype and evaluate a new design of remote control system. The main feature of our project is to integrate a remote controller with a mobile app. Such an innovative design can be used to enhance the user experience of tractor operators.
